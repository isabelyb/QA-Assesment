## 1. Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing is a method to test the software, in which tests are not pre-defined. Therefore, those tests are designed, executed, logged, and evaluated during the evaluation, and its results allow learning more about the software tested and the creation of more tests in case necessary.

Exploratory testing is most used when:
* There is not time enough to test all functionalities
* To complement other more formal testing techniques.
* There are not documentation and specifications enough about the software

## 2. Test Cases

Test cases in `Gherkin` for "Cantidad de Empresas" section:

* [By Sector](testCases/byCompanies/bySector.feature)
* [By Department](testCases/byCompanies/byDepartment.feature)
* [By Category](testCases/byCompanies/byCategory.feature)

It is possible to do all in one test using an `Scenario outline`:

* [By Companies - Scenario outline](testCases/byCompanies.outline.feature)
